This is an OpenGL demo featuring simple per-pixel
diffuse lighting using a pixel shader written in
Cg; the demo was posted along with an article at
http://www.3ddrome.com/
It's been developed and tested on Slackware Linux.

To build it, just run 'make' (you may have to edit the
Makefile). This will create an executable called 'main'
that you can then run. Press the 'Escape' key to exit
the demo.

The code is distributed under a BSD-style license.
